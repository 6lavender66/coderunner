Please treat the above repository as an attempt to learn classes in python + the py.game library itself.

The repository contains two files, the ending 00 is the prototype (hence its name) and 01 is the alpha version.

Despite the rather simple graphic design, please consider the above program as a kind of art.

See you someday
